# Firefox Kiosk Application Progress

## Current State (March 21, 2025)

### Implemented Features

1. **Firefox Kiosk Mode**
   - Successfully implemented a full-screen kiosk mode using Firefox
   - Custom profile creation with necessary preferences
   - Automatic navigation to specified homepage

2. **UI Customization**
   - Removed Firefox UI elements (address bar, tabs, etc.)
   - Implemented custom CSS via userChrome.css
   - Used JavaScript DOM manipulation to hide persistent UI elements
   - Disabled Firefox's built-in view tab and other UI components

3. **Security Features**
   - Keyboard shortcut blocking:
     - Successfully blocked Alt+D (focus address bar)
     - Successfully blocked Ctrl+Shift+M (responsive design mode)
     - Added system-level Alt+Tab blocking (nuclear approach)
   - Disabled developer tools
   - Prevented navigation to unauthorized domains
   - Implemented custom navigation mechanisms

4. **Navigation Controls**
   - Improved navigation reliability
   - Added checks for successful navigation
   - Enhanced handling of Mozilla domains
   - Added fallback mechanisms for navigation failures

### Known Issues

1. **Orange Line Issue**
   - Fixed by adding CSS to hide fullscreen notifications and tab line elements

2. **Mozilla Link Access**
   - Enhanced navigation to handle Mozilla domains more reliably
   - Added mechanisms to maintain kiosk mode during navigation

3. **Keyboard Shortcut Blocking**
   - Alt+Tab blocking implementation may cause system-wide keyboard blocking when active
   - Some shortcuts may still be accessible in certain edge cases

### Next Steps

1. **Refine Alt+Tab Blocking**
   - Investigate less aggressive approaches that don't interfere with system usability
   - Ensure blocking methods don't cause the application to freeze

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add more robust error recovery mechanisms
   - Implement automatic recovery from navigation failures

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduce resource usage of continuous monitoring loops
   - Optimize startup time and profile creation

4. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive testing across different environments
   - Verify all blocking mechanisms work as expected
